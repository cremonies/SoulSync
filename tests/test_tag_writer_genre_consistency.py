"""Genre-diff-suppression consistency (commit 73ec9c7a):

``build_tag_diff`` suppresses a genre "change" when the DB's genre value
is a pure subset of the file's existing (richer) genre list — meant to
stop automated enrichment from downgrading a rich file tag to a generic
single DB genre (e.g. "Pop"). But ``write_tags_to_file`` had no matching
guard: a batch write (gated on ``build_tag_diff``'s ``changed`` flag)
would silently skip the file entirely, while a single-track write (which
calls ``write_tags_to_file`` directly, bypassing the diff) would still
overwrite the richer file value — contradicting what the diff/preview
told the user. The same subset check must apply in both places so the
preview and the actual write always agree.
