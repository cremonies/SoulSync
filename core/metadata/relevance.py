"""Local relevance re-ranking for metadata-source search results.

Background
----------

Some metadata sources (Deezer notably) return search results in a
relevance order that puts karaoke covers, "originally performed by",
re-recorded versions, tribute compilations, and Vocal/Backing-Track
variants ABOVE the actual studio recording the user is looking for.
Their global popularity ordering means anything that appears across
many compilations outranks the canonical track. Issue #534 is the
canonical example: searching `Dirty White Boy` + `Foreigner` returned
five karaoke / cover variants before the real Foreigner studio cut.

This module is a provider-neutral helper. Given a list of typed
``Track`` results plus an expected title + artist, it re-ranks by
local heuristics that the source's own ranking ignores:

- Hard penalty for known cover/karaoke/tribute patterns (title OR
  album OR artist field). These rarely belong in import / match
  results when the user typed the original artist.
- Soft penalty for variant types (Live, Acoustic, Remix, Demo,
  Instrumental) UNLESS the user's expected title also contains the
  variant tag (so "Track (Live)" search matches Live recordings).
- Boost for exact artist match — the strongest signal that this is
  the canonical recording.
- Title similarity via SequenceMatcher on normalised strings (drop
  parentheticals + punctuation before comparison).
- Album-type weight: album > compilation > single (compilations are
  more likely to be tributes / "best of" repackages).

Pure-function design over the canonical ``Track`` dataclass —
no Deezer-specific assumptions, applies to iTunes / Spotify /
Hydrabase results equally well. Each scoring component is its own
small function so tests can pin them independently.

Usage
-----

>>> from core.metadata.relevance import rerank_tracks
>>> tracks = client.search_tracks(query)
>>> ranked = rerank_tracks(tracks, expected_title='Dirty White Boy', expected_artist='Foreigner')
>>> # ranked[0] is now the most relevant; karaoke variants drop to bottom
