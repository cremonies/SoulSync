"""Build a listening-history event from a SoulSync web-player play.

Pure, DB-agnostic. ``listening_history`` is otherwise populated only from the
media server (Plex/Jellyfin/Navidrome) by ``listening_stats_worker``; this lets
the WEB PLAYER record its own plays too, so "recently played" and the Phase-2
smart-radio recency signal reflect what was actually played in SoulSync.

Kept as a pure function so it's unit-testable without a DB or Flask: it
normalizes the player's track payload into the exact event shape
``MusicDatabase.insert_listening_events`` expects.

    ``played_at`` MUST be supplied by the caller (an ISO timestamp string) —
    this module never reads the clock, so it stays pure/testable. Returns None
    when there's nothing worth logging (no title), so callers can skip cleanly.

    ``profile_id`` is the one thing this event knows for certain about WHO
    played it - the web player runs inside a session that already identifies
    the profile, unlike a media-server poll that has to guess from account
    links. Callers pass ``core.profile_context.get_current_profile_id()``;
    pure/unit tests can leave it None to record an unattributed play, same as
    every row before this field existed.

    The event shape matches insert_listening_events():
      track_id, title, artist, album, played_at, duration_ms, server_source,
